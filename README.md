# JavaScript Interview Questions

This repo contains all question posted on [TheTalkingDev](https://www.youtube.com/@thetalkingdev) YouTube Channel on the Playlist of JavaScript interview questions. Most of these questions are code related.

I am using Vite as my server, it is an awesome tool to use with JavaScript. The HTML page as you can see is not complex, it is simple. This is because in Vite you must have a HTML entry file. All the code snippets are in the src folder, running from #01 to the latest.

## Requirements

You only need VsCode, or any code editor NodeJs to run Vite server.

_PS:_ A quick note, you do not need Vite server/configurations. All you need is a code editor. You can even use browser console to test your code. I just prefer this setup.

_Incase anything just reach out ðŸ˜œ._
